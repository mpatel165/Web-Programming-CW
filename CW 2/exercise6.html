	<h1>Advising</h1>
	<li>
	If I have to advise the school that cascading style sheets can be used. The reason is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Cascading style sheets reflects the school's structure. School and its various departments can each tailor the style sheet (using a hierarchy of style sheets) to suite their own image, thereby providing some control and consistency over the overall layout without being too restrictive on each department's Web page design.</li>
	<li>If the school were to change its image in the future, style sheets provide a quick and easy way to do so.</li>
	<li>If a design change is required during the development of the website, then style sheets provide a quick and easy method to do so.
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li>While if every teacher were to write their own style, the school's image would be lost. Further, updating these separate designs to meet some future design standard is an difficult task.</li>
